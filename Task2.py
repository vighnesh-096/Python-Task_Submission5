# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
# 2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
# 3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
# 4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

numbers = list(range(1,11))
print(f"Original List: {numbers}")
numbers_firstFive = numbers[:5]
print(f"Extend First Five Number: {numbers_firstFive}")
reversed_numbers = numbers_firstFive[::-1]
print(f"reversed extend First Five Numbers: {reversed_numbers}")
